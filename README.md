# PROJECT-DIRECTORY
Projects are an essential and enjoying part of the college academics. However, students, especially of 1st and 2nd year, are confused while selecting project topics. They are troubled in where to start and what to do. This website will feature multiple projects collected from NIT(Agartala) Seniors. I believe that this website will be of certain help to all juniors.

I'll further try to add features, where anyone can add their projects under certain category, such as Web Development Projects, Web3 Projects, Android Development Projects, ML Projects, Deep Learning Projects etc. Each project will contain description of the project, output of the project, source of the project and github profile of the project owner.

All The Best for your Projects!!!

If you want to collaborate then do let me know. You are more than welcome for collaboration. Anyways, This will be an open source project, so you'll are welcome to contribute.
