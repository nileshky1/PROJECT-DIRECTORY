# PROJECT-DIRECTORY
Projects are an essential and enjoying part of the college academics. However, students, especially of 1st and 2nd year, are confused while selecting project topics. They are troubled in where to start and what to do. This website features multiple projects collected from NIT(Agartala) Seniors. I believe that this website will be of certain help to you all.

All The Best for your Projects!!!

If you want to collaborate then do let me know. If you know backend, then you are more than welcome for collaboration. Anyways, This will be an open source project, so you'll are welcome to contribute.
